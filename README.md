# energycalc

This suite of natural gas and crude oil mass balance and valuation tools was originally created at the Texas General Land Office (GLO), and was approved for public release as a privately-maintained open source project on December 15, 2020 by the Deputy Director of Energy Resources (see GitHub_Authorization.pdf).  Privately-written web application code was thereafter added to the repository in the "web" folder as well.  These tools have been retired from GLO use, and no official support is provided for this code.
